                   <h2>Bryce Canyon City, UT</h2>
                   <p>Two summers ago, my family and I took a trip out west to visit some of the most beautiful national park that Utah and Arizona holds. The first place we visted was Bryce Canyon in southern Utah. This was one of the most unique and interesting place I have ever been to.</p>

                   <h2>Springdale, UT</h2>
                   <p>Zion National Park was probably my favorite stop out of all the places we were lucky enough to visit. This place was out of this world, I though we had entered Jurassic Park when we arrived. There is so much you can do in Zion; we hiked Angels Landing, hiked through The Narrows, and witnessed some of the most beautiful sunsets.</p>

                   <h2>Page, AR</h2>
                   <p>Just before our final stop to the Grand Conyon, we visited Antelope Canyon along with Horeshoe Bend. These destination were both sites that you always see as a screen savor and the picture hardly do them justice, these places were so unique and breathtaking. Truly shows how incredibly beautiful our country is.</p>

                   <h2>Northern Arizona</h2>
                   <p>Our final stop was at the famous Grand Canyon that most everybody is familirar with. The Grand Canyon was absolutley massive and breathe taking. It is truly a site that everybody should witness at least once in there life. Overall, this trip was one of, if not, my favorite trip i have ever been on and i highly recommend any of these national parks to anyone.</p>
